                <p class="lead voice-brand">
                            The Coin is awarded to ITLPs who during their term exhibit and live the GE Beliefs.
                            By fully living the GE Beliefs, ITLPs serve as example for other associates in their network. 
                            This is a key part in instilling the corporate culture among our community bringing new opportunities to both colleagues and customers. 
                            These experiences will shape the future of the company and reveal the true meaning of being an ITLP.</p>

                <h1 class="title voice-brand">Who is elegible?</h1>
                <p class="lead voice-brand">
                            The Coin can be awarded to any ITLP that has at least two stories approved during the two-year time of the program.</p>
                <br>
                <h1 class="title voice-brand">How are coins awarded?</h1>
                <p class="lead voice-brand">
                            Assignment Leaders, Business Representatives/Program Managers can submit stories about a valued ITLP, but only Program Managers can do so directly. 
                            Stories submitted by ALs and Business Representatives/Program Managers will be reviewed by the Committee. 
                            The Committee is notified by email when a new story is submitted by Assignment Leaders and/or Business Representatives/Program Managers. The ITLP will be notified by email at story approval.
                            Approved stories are also posted to Colab, MyGEStory and the ITLP Blog. 
                            ITLPs who have at least two stories approved will receive their coin upon graduation. This will encourage consistency in ITLP expectations, development, and motivation for global ITLPs.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Each rotation cycle Business Representatives and/or Program Managers will have a pre-defined number of coins, based on the number of submitted stories (15%). 
                            Stories should be submitted until the last business day of the rotation, and only then will they be reviewed.</p>
